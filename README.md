Sneakers Fashion Website Scraper Documentation
Authors: Amir Sayab, Muzammil Ahmed

Overview
The "Sneakers Fashion Website Scraper" is a Python application that allows users to scrape data from a specified website and export the scraped data to a CSV file. The application uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that accepts a website URL, performs web scraping, and displays the scraped data in a tabular format.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python Libraries: tkinter, requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
How to Use
Execute the main.py script to launch the GUI application.
GUI Interface:
Enter the website URL you want to scrape data from in the provided input field.
Click the "Scrape Data" button to initiate the web scraping process.
Web Scraping:
The application will send an HTTP request to the provided URL using the requests library.
It will retrieve the HTML content of the website and parse it using BeautifulSoup to extract relevant data.
The data extracted will include "Sneaker Name," "Price," "Attributes" (size and brand), and "Published Date."
Displaying Data:
The scraped data will be displayed in a tabular format using the tkinter Treeview widget.
The columns in the table will be "Sneaker Name," "Price," "Attributes," and "Published Date."
Export to CSV:
The "Export to CSV" button allows you to save the scraped data to a CSV file named "sneakers_data.csv."
The data will be appended to the existing file (if available) so that previous data is not overwritten.
Error Handling:
If there are any issues with fetching data from the website or parsing the content, error messages will be displayed using tkinter's messagebox.
Known Limitations
The application is designed to scrape data from websites with specific HTML structures, particularly suited for sneaker fashion websites. It may not work correctly on websites with different structures.
Web scraping may not be allowed or may be restricted on some websites based on their terms of service. Use the application responsibly and ensure you have permission to scrape data from the website you intend to use.
